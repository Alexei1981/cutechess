    Installation


SloppyGUI requires Qt (atleast version 4.2) and qmake, the Qt Makefile
generator. The current qmake project file doesn't have support for
installations. However the main executable has the necessary resources
built-in by default so it's the only thing you need to deploy.

First you need to build the Makefile:

    $ qmake

And to build the source:

    $ make

Manual page is available but you have to built it separately. Building it
requires asciidoc (http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/).

    $ make doc-man

If you want to have an overview of SloppyGUI's source you can build the API
documentation:

    $ make doc-api

You need doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/) in order to build the API
documentation.
