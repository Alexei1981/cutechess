    Installation


Cute Chess requires Qt (at least version 4.6) and qmake (the Qt Makefile
generator). The current qmake project file doesn't have support for
installations. However the main executable has the necessary resources built-in
by default so it's the only thing you need to deploy.

If you're using Qt Creator to build the sources you can skip the rest of this
document.

First you need to build Cute Chess' Makefile in either release or debug mode.
Release mode is for general program usage and offers the best performance.
Debug mode is for debugging Cute Chess.

To build the Makefile in release mode:

    $ qmake -config release

    or in debug mode:

    $ qmake -config debug

And to build the source:

    $ make

    or

    $ nmake (Visual C++)

To build on a Macintosh, add "-spec macx-g++" to the qmake command.

Documentation is available as Unix manual pages in the "docs" directory.

If you want to have an overview of Cute Chess' source you can build the API
documentation:

    $ make doc-api

You need doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/) in order to build the API
documentation.
