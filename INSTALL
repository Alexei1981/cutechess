    Installation


Cute Chess requires Qt (atleast version 4.4) and qmake, the Qt Makefile
generator. The current qmake project file doesn't have support for
installations. However the main executable has the necessary resources
built-in by default so it's the only thing you need to deploy.

First you need to build the Makefile in either release or debug mode.
Release mode is for general program usage and offers the best
performance. Debug mode is for debugging Cute Chess.

To build the Makefile in release mode (default):

    $ qmake

    or in debug mode:

    $ qmake -config debug

And to build the source:

    $ make

    or

    $ nmake (Visual C++)

To build on a Macintosh, add "-spec macx-g++" to the qmake command.

Documentation is available as Unix manual pages and in HTML format. Building
the documentation in either format requires asciidoc
(http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/).

    $ make doc-man     (documentation as Unix manual pages)
    $ make doc-html    (documentation in HTML format)

The documentation is built to the "docs" directory.

If you want to have an overview of Cute Chess's source you can build the API
documentation:

    $ make doc-api

You need doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/) in order to build the API
documentation.
