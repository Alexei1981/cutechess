    Installation


Cute Chess requires Qt (at least version 4.5), qmake (the Qt Makefile
generator) and QJson. The current qmake project file doesn't have support for
installations. However the main executable has the necessary resources built-in
by default so it's the only thing you need to deploy.

First you need to make sure that QJson is installed. On Unix and derivates you
should be able to install it through package manager. 0.7.0+ version of QJson
is highly recommended due to problems in earlier versions. On Windows the
easiest way is to drop the QJson source files to "3rdparty/qjson/" directory
under "projects/lib" and make a local installation of QJson. So, with 'cmake'
program installed in "3rdparty/qjson/" directory:

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=.
    make
    make install

QJSon is now installed to the current directory where Cute Chess' build system
will pick it up.

Next you need to build Cute Chess' Makefile in either release or debug mode.
Release mode is for general program usage and offers the best
performance. Debug mode is for debugging Cute Chess.

To build the Makefile in release mode:

    $ qmake -config release

    or in debug mode:

    $ qmake -config debug

And to build the source:

    $ make

    or

    $ nmake (Visual C++)

To build on a Macintosh, add "-spec macx-g++" to the qmake command.

Documentation is available as Unix manual pages and in HTML format. Building
the documentation in either format requires asciidoc
(http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/).

    $ make doc-man     (documentation as Unix manual pages)
    $ make doc-html    (documentation in HTML format)

The documentation is built to the "docs" directory.

If you want to have an overview of Cute Chess' source you can build the API
documentation:

    $ make doc-api

You need doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/) in order to build the API
documentation.
