- Add more stuff to the Chess namespace (Game, Player, etc.)
  chess.h should probably be in lib/src, not lib/src/chessboard

- Human player

- Complete Xboard and UCI support (including the analysis feature)

- Allow players to resign on the opponent's turn. This means stopping the
  other player's thinking.

- Detect when a player's flag falls. When the player gets his turn, start a timer
  which fires when the time runs out. If the player moves before it happens,
  the timer is killed/reset. But even then, check the accurate elapsed time to
  see if the flag fell.

- More unit tests for the Chess library

- Give better weights (not just popularity) to imported opening book moves

- Better error handling in OpeningBook

- Better error handling in PgnGame

- FICS support

- Tournaments

- Add a bunch of bugs to Sloppy, and test it with the gui

- Create an engine-testing tool for the gui, which finds out and summarizes
  the engine's features, and runs tests:
  - illegal moves
  - invalid FEN strings
  - very long strings
  - invalid time controls (eg. negative time left)
  - negative minimum search depth
  - test the ping time
