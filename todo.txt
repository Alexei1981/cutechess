- Add more stuff to the Chess namespace (Game, Player, etc.)
  chess.h should probably be in lib/src, not lib/src/chessboard

- Human player

- Complete Xboard and UCI support (including the analysis feature)

- Allow players to resign on the opponent's turn. This means stopping the
  other player's thinking.

- More unit tests for the Chess library

- Give better weights (not just popularity) to imported opening book moves

- Better error handling in OpeningBook

- Better error handling in PgnGame

- FICS support

- Tournaments

- Add a bunch of bugs to Sloppy, and test it with the gui

- Create an engine-testing tool for the gui, which finds out and summarizes
  the engine's features, and runs tests:
  - illegal moves
  - invalid FEN strings
  - very long strings
  - invalid time controls (eg. negative time left)
  - negative minimum search depth
  - test the ping time

- Include annotations (eval + search depth + move time) in saved PGN files

- Use ECO codes to determine the opening name for PGN games

- Ping an engine before it starts thinking

- Allow a PGN game to be used as a starting point for a ChessGame

- EPD tests for engines

- Command line tool for running engine vs. engine matches and tournaments

- Design an XML format for tournaments

- Switch to a QAbstractItemView-based graphical board
