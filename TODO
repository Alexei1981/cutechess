- Add more stuff to the Chess namespace (Game, Player, etc.)
  chess.h should probably be in lib/src, not lib/src/chessboard

- Complete Xboard and UCI support (including the analysis feature)

- More unit tests for the Chess library

- Better error handling in OpeningBook

- Better error handling in PgnGame

- FICS support

- Tournaments

- Add a bunch of bugs to Sloppy, and test it with the gui

- Create an engine-testing tool for the gui, which finds out and summarizes
  the engine's features, and runs tests:
  - illegal moves
  - invalid FEN strings
  - very long strings
  - invalid time controls (eg. negative time left)
  - negative minimum search depth
  - test the ping time

- Use ECO codes to determine the opening name for PGN games

- EPD tests for engines

- Design an XML format for tournaments

- Provide code examples in documentation

- Add proper player killswitches for debugging purposes (GUI)

  This could be expanded further to kill the underlying chess engine process
  instead of using the library procedures to simulate how the gui reacts to
  program crashes

- Verify Qt version requirement before release

- (Mac) dropping FEN on Cute Chess' icon in Dock

- Use PgnStream for HTTP downloading
