- Add more stuff to the Chess namespace (Game, Player, etc.)
  chess.h should probably be in lib/src, not lib/src/chessboard

- Complete Xboard and UCI support (including the analysis feature)

- More unit tests for the Chess library

- Better error handling in OpeningBook

- Better error handling in PgnGame

- FICS support

- Tournaments

- Add a bunch of bugs to Sloppy, and test it with the gui

- Create an engine-testing tool for the gui, which finds out and summarizes
  the engine's features, and runs tests:
  - illegal moves
  - invalid FEN strings
  - very long strings
  - invalid time controls (eg. negative time left)
  - negative minimum search depth
  - test the ping time

- EPD tests for engines

- Design a file format for tournaments

- Provide code examples in documentation

- Verify Qt version requirement before release

- Use PgnStream for HTTP downloading

- Apply for the Qt Ambassador program (application showcase) after first
  public release: http://qt.nokia.com/qtambassador

- Use model testing tools to check validity of all model classes
  during runtime (http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/Model_Test)

- Prepare for Qt 5

- Allow setting engine options again for each game instead of only once for the whole match

- Support the Xboard "draw" command

- WesternBoard should support file and rank strings of arbitrary length

- Update documentation for engines.json. At the moment there's nothing about
  "restart", "variants" or "options".


User Interface
--------------

- (Mac) dropping FEN on Cute Chess' icon in Dock

- (Mac) provide Dock menu

- (Mac) provide global menubar

- Per window dialogs should use QDialog::open() instead of exec()

- Moving a piece by selecting (clicking with a mouse) a source and a
  destination squares

- Highlight attacked pieces

- Application icon that looks good on Win, Mac, GTK. Examples: Firefox, Arora.
  Should have (at least) sizes of 512x512, 128x128, 32x32, 16x16

- Analyzing feature. Probably should be placed in its own dock window with a
  selectable list of engines.

- All game information should be editable in Game|Properties.

- There should be no "whitepov" option for UCI engines (it should always be OFF)

- Add a time control widget that can be embedded in New Game dialog

- MoveListModel and/or the view need some changes because white doesn't
  always start the game, and in some variants white isn't even the default
  starting side. Now the first move always goes in the "white" column.
