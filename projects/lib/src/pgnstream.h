 * \brief A class for reading games in PGN format from a text stream.
 *
 * PgnStream is used for reading PGN games from a QIODevice or a string.
 * It has its own input methods, and keeps track of the current line
 * number which can be used to report errors in the games. PgnStream
 * also has its own Chess::Board object, so that the same board can be
 * easily used with all the games in the stream.
