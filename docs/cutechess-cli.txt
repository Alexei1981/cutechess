EXAMPLES
--------

* Play ten games between two Sloppy engines with a time
control of 40 moves in 60 seconds.

-----------
$ cutechess-cli -both cmd=sloppy tc=40/60 -games 10
-----------

* Use the 'name=Atak' parameter because it's a Xboard
protocol 1 engine and doesn't tell its name.

* Use the 'dir=C:\atak' parameter to point the location of
the executable.

* Glaurung can tell its name and is in the PATH variable
so only the command is needed.

* Set Glaurung to use 1 thread.

* Set the time control to 40 moves in one minute and 30
seconds with a one second increment.

-----------
$ cutechess-cli -fcp name=Atak cmd=Atak32.exe dir=C:\atak proto=xboard -scp cmd=glaurung proto=uci cpus=1 -both tc=40/1:30+1
